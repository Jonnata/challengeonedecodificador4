## Overview

### Text Decoder - Alura Challenges Oracle ONE

The encryption "keys" I used are:
- The letter "e" is converted to "enter"
- The letter "i" is converted to "imes"
- The letter "a" is converted to "ai"
- The letter "o" is converted to "ober"
- The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"

Requirements:
- Should only work with lowercase letters
- Letters with accents or special characters must not be used
- It must be possible to convert a word to the encrypted version and also return an encrypted word to the original version.

For example:
#### "cat" => "gaitober"
#### gaitober" => "cat"

- The page has fields for entering the text to be encrypted or decrypted, and the user can choose between the two options
- The result is displayed on the screen.
